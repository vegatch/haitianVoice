Web news projects
This is a web news project however different from most web news out there so far in a sense we will add a rubric where people can add what they see and hear in real time. To avoid spreading fake news. These information will be labelled as non confirmed yet until we verify its veracity. It will also include a discussion space under every article where people can react.
