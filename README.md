Web news projects
This is a web news project however different from most web news out there so far in a sense we will add a rubric where people can add what they see and hear in real time. To avoid spreading fake news. These information will be labelled as non confirmed yet until we verify its veracity. It will also include a discussion space under every article where people can react.  


One of this innovative feature is in the section of people voice where anyone can post an article on a any subject susceptible to promote change in Haiti. Hate speech is banned from this platform ant article with hate speech in its content will be removed in the platform immediately after discovery. Traditional news media reserves their microphone only to an elite in our country and we do believe that any single haitian on any walking life has something and/or do to change this country we all love and cherish.
